## Firebase Integration

### **Firebase Authentication**

fun loginUser(email: String, password: String) {
    auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
        .addOnCompleteListener { task ->
            if (task.isSuccessful) {
                Log.d("Login", "Login successful")
            } else {
                Log.d("Login", "Login failed: ${task.exception?.message}")
            }
        }
}
```

### **Firebase Firestore Setup**

```kotlin
// Firestore Database for Storing Posts
val db = FirebaseFirestore.getInstance()

fun addPost(post: Post) {
    db.collection("posts")
        .add(post)
        .addOnSuccessListener { documentReference ->
            Log.d("Firestore", "Post added with ID: ${documentReference.id}")
        }
        .addOnFailureListener { e ->
            Log.w("Firestore", "Error adding post", e)
        }
}
```

### **Firebase Storage for Image Upload**

```kotlin
// Uploading Image to Firebase Storage
val storageRef = FirebaseStorage.getInstance().reference.child("posts/${UUID.randomUUID()}.jpg")

fun uploadImage(fileUri: Uri) {
    storageRef.putFile(fileUri)
        .addOnSuccessListener {
            Log.d("Storage", "Image upload successful")
        }
        .addOnFailureListener { e ->

## Photo Duel Feature

### **Overview**
The **Photo Duel** feature is a gamified comparison tool that allows users to post two images side-by-side and let others vote on which one they prefer. The feature includes real-time vote updates and automatic winner declaration after the voting period.

### **Core Functionality**
- Create duels by selecting two images, adding captions, and setting a time limit.
- Allow other users to vote for either image.
- Automatically declare a winner when the time limit expires.
- Duels are displayed in a horizontally scrolling list at the top of the home feed.

### **Data Flow**
1. **Creating a Duel**  
    - User selects two images from the gallery.
    - Adds captions and sets a time limit.
    - Images are uploaded to Firebase Storage.
    - Duel data (image URLs, captions, time limit) is saved in Firestore.

2. **Displaying Duels**  
    - HomeFragment fetches duels from Firestore.
    - Duels are displayed using a horizontally scrolling RecyclerView.
    - Ended duels display the winner and disable voting.

3. **Voting Process**  
    - Users vote by clicking on either image.
    - Vote count is incremented via a Firestore transaction.
    - UI updates to reflect new vote count.

4. **Winner Declaration**  
    - System checks if the duel has ended.
    - Compares vote counts and declares a winner.
    - UI displays the winner and voting is disabled.

### **Security & Moderation**
- A **"Do not compare humans"** warning is displayed to discourage harmful comparisons.
- Firebase rules ensure only valid duels are processed.
